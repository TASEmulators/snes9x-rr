		<h3>Satellaview</h3>
		<p>
			Snes9x partially emulates Satellaview system, so-called BS-X. To play BS games or read BS magazines with the BS-X base cartridge, do the following.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Trash all .srm files of BS games which were created by Snes9x 1.43 and earlier.
			<li>Prepare the BS-X ROM. Make sure the file is uncompressed and doesn't have a header.
			<li>Rename the BS-X ROM to 'BS-X.bin'.
			<li>Put BS-X.bin in the proper directory. 'BIOSs' folder by default.
			<li>Launch BS-X.bin as you usually play SNES games.
			<li>Set your name and gender.
			<li>Launch a BS game. The game is launched for the first time and its .srm doesn't exist, so BS-X.srm is loaded instead.
			<li>Once you launched the game, its .srm is created and loaded from the next time.
		</ul>
		<p>
			If you launch a BS game for the first time without BS-X.srm, maybe the game doesn't work properly.<br>
			To boot up BS games from BS-X town, turn on 'Boot Up BS Games from BS-X' option in 'Preferences' dialog.
		</p><br>
		<h3>Sufami Turbo</h3>
		<p>
			To play Sufami Turbo games, do the following.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Prepare the Sufami Turbo base cartridge ROM. Make sure the file is uncompressed and doesn't have a header.
			<li>Rename the base cartridge ROM to 'STBIOS.bin'.
			<li>Put STBIOS.bin in the proper directory. 'BIOSs' folder by default.
			<li>Choose 'Open Multiple ROM Images...' from 'File' menu.
			<li>Set game(s) into each slot with 'Choose...', 'Clear' and 'Swap' buttons. You can also drag and drop the ROM image onto each slot.
			<li>Push 'OK' button and the Sufami Turbo system will run.
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note that the base cartridge can initialize SRAM for only the game in slot A, so you have to set every games in slot A and launch at least once.<br>
			If no games are set in the slots, only the base cartridge runs.<br>
			If you have a combined image, split it to each games and the base cartridge. NSRT will help you.
		</p><br>
		<h3>Other Multiple Cartridge Games</h3>
		<p>
			In 'Open Multiple ROM Images' dialog, put the main cartridge in slot A and the add-on cartridge in slot B.<br>
			Currectly supported: Same Game
