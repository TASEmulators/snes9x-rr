		<h3>Problems With ROMs</h3>
		<p>
			If the emulator just displays a black screen for over 10 seconds after you've loaded a ROM image, then one of the following could be true:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You just loaded some random ROM image and it isn't even a SNES game or you only have part of the image. Snes9x only emulates games designed for the Super NES, not NES, or Master System, or Game Boy, or &lt;insert your favorite old games system here&gt;.
			<li>If it's a Super FX game, chances are it's in mode 2 interleaved format, try switching to 'Force Mode 2' on the ROM load dialog before loading the game.
			<li>Someone has edited the Nintendo ROM information area inside the ROM image and Snes9x can't work out what format ROM image is in. Try playing around with the ROM format options on the ROM load dialog.
			<li>The ROM image is corrupt. If you're loading from CD, I know it might sound silly, but is the CD dirty? Clean, unhacked ROM images will display [checksum ok] when first loaded, corrupt or hacked ROMs display [bad checksum].
			<li>The original SNES ROM cartridge had additional hardware inside that is not emulated yet and might never be.
			<li>You might be using a file that is compressed in a way Snes9x does not understand.
		</ul>
		<p>
			The following ROMs are known to currently not to work with any version of Snes9x:
