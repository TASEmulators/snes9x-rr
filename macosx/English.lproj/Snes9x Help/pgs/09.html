		<h2>Netplay Support</h2>
		<p>
			Netplay support allows up to five players to sit in front of different computers and simultaneously play the same game, or just watch someone else play a game. All the computers have to be connected to a network that allows TCP/IP traffic to flow between them; this includes a local Ethernet-style network, a direct-cable connection, or, if you're lucky and have short ping times, the Internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Snes9x netplay inevitably synchronizes all the computers at the sacrifice of the speed of input response. Note that this feature is Mac OS X only - not compatible with Windows and other platforms.
		</p><br>
		<h3>How to Netplay</h3>
		<p>
			The player with the fastest Mac should act as the server (S). The others are clients (C). Server should open the port 6096/TCP.<br>
			Here is the workflow to netplay with up to five players.
